**Best Practices**

**Middleware Controller Best Practices**

* Use to implement API key, user-agent restriction, CSRF, XSRF security, token based API authentication.
* Use to implement API request rate limit.
* Logging of incoming HTTP requests.
* Redirecting the users based on requests.
* Middleware can inspect a request and decorate it, or reject it, based on what it finds.
* Middleware is most often considered separate from your application logic.
* Middleware gives you enough freedom to create your own security mechanism.
