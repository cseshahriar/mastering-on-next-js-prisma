**Best Practices**

**Request Body**

* Request body should be structured in JSON Array/Object pattern
* Request body hold multipart/form-data like images, audio, video etc
* Request body should not hold any auth related information.
* Request body should associated with specific request data model, setter getter can used for this

**Request Header**

* Request header should carry all security related information, like token, auth etc.
* Only string Key\:Pair value is allowed for header.
* Request header should provide user agent information of client application.
* If necessary CSRF/XSRF should provide via header.
* Request header should associated with middleware controller, where necessary
