Best Practice
-------------
Response Body:
- avoid providing response status code, message via response Body
- Use json best Practice for json response Body
- for small result , can use string, bool directly
- provide proper json encode-decode before writing json Body


Response Cookies:
- a restful api may send cookies just like a regular web application the serves html
- avoid using response cookies as it is violate stateless principle
- if required use cookie encryption, decryption and other policies


Response Header:
----------------
- provide proper http response status code
- provide proper content type, file type if any
- provide cache status if any
- authentication token should provide via response Header
- only string data is allow for response Header
- provide content length if any
- provide response date and time
- follow request response model describe before

Key REST API principles:
* REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs) are a type of API architecture
    that provides several standards and conventions that must be followed to
    facilitate communication between applications.
* REST APIs are designed to be stateless, scalable, flexible, and easy to use.
* REST APIs are platform-independent and can be used with any programming language.
* REST APIs support multiple data formats, such as JSON, XML, and plain text.
* REST APIs can take advantage of HTTP caching mechanisms, reducing server load
     and improving response times for repeated requests.
