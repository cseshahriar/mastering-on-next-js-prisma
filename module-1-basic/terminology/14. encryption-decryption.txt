The image also shows a diagram of public key encryption where:

* The sender encrypts plaintext using the recipient’s **public key**
* The recipient decrypts the ciphertext using their **private key**
* Different keys are used for encryption and decryption

Let me know if you want an explanation of any of the listed algorithms.

Here is the complete text from the image:

**Diagram (Description):**

* **Sender** sends **Plaintext**
* Plaintext is **Encrypted** using the **Recipient’s Public Key**
* Becomes **Ciphertext**
* Ciphertext is **Decrypted** using the **Recipient’s Private Key**
* **Recipient** receives the **Plaintext**

> *Different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt message*

Let me know if you’d like this rewritten or explained further.
